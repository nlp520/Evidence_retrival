0	THE CORRECT AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATENESS SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPED FEATURE STRUCTURES
0	in this pa,per, we argue tha, t type inferencing incorrectly implements a.pl)rolwiateness specifica.tions for typed [ea.ture structures, promote a combina.tion of l;ype resolution and unfilling a,s a. correct a.nd ef'~ ticient Mternative, and consider the expressive limits of this a.lterna.tive approa.ch.
0	!['hroughout, we use feature cooccurence restrictions as illustration and linguistic motivation.
0	Unification lbrmMisms ma.y be either un-typed (DCC~s, PATRII, 1,F(;) or typed (npsG).
0	A m~L,ior reason for adding types to ~ forma,lism is to express restrictions on fea.ture cooccurences a.s in (;l's(:: [5] in order to rule out nonexista.nt tyl)es of objects.
0	For example, there a.re no verbs which have the [km.ture +R. The simplest way to express such restrictions is by mea.ns of a.n a.ppropria.teness pa.r-tim flmction Approp: Type  Feat ~ Type.
0	With such a.n a.pl)rol)riatleness specifica.- tion lrla.tly Sllch restrictioi,s may be expressed, though no restrictions involving reentrancies ma.y be expressed.
0	In this pal)er, we will first in 2 survey the range of type eonstra.ints tha.t ma.y be expressed with just a. type hiera.rchy and *']'he resea.rch pl'eS(!lllL('d ill |,his; paper was pay tia.lly sponsored hy '[kfilprojekt B4 "(;onsl.rahH.s on Grammar fl~r Efficient Ck:neration" of the Soi,der forschungsbereich 340 of the Deutsche ["orschungsgemeinscha, ft.

0	1 Unlike previous systems such as ALl,:, Troll does not employ a.ny type infereneing, inste~M, a, limited amount of named disjunction ([1 1], [12], [6])is introduced to record type resol u tion possibilities.
0	The a.lnount of dis- junction is a.lso kept small by the technique of unlilli,g described in [9].

0	well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure, in ALl.:, type infereneing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable--in fact, all feature structures are well typed.
0	Unfortunately, well-typability is not sufficient to ensure that disjunctive FCRs are satisfied.
0	Consider, For exam- pie, our encoding of the disjunctive FCR p and suppose that 99 is the fe, ature structure t[f : +,9 : -].
0	90 is well-typed, and hence trivially well-typable.
0	Unfortunately, 99 vb elates the encoded disjunctive FCR p. The only way one could interpret ~ as well-formed.
1	By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an etfeetive algorithm f<>r deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure.
1	We write fS, ~vf8 and 'D~.)c$ for the collections of feature structures, resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively.
1	Say that F'E RFS is a resolvant of F E FS iff F and F' have the same underlying graph and F subsumes F'.
1	Let type resolution be the total function R:->DRFS such that R(F) is the set of all resolvants of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions, King [13] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R(F) 0.
0	T$ is satisfial~le if[' 7~(F) 7 ~ (7).
0	C, erdemann ,% King [8] have also shown that a feature strtlcture l]leets all encoded FCRs ifl" the feature structure is satisfiable.
0	The Troll system, which is based on this idea, effectively inqflements type resolution.
0	Why does type resohttion succeed where.
0	type inferencing fails?
0	Consider again the encoding of p and the feature structure 9~.
0	Loosely speaking, the appropriateness sl)eeifieations for type t encode the part of p that sta, tes that an object of tyl)e t deserves features f and g, both with boolean vahles.
0	However, the appropriateness specifications for the speci- ate sul)types t' and t" of type t encode the part of p that states that these val-lies lnust agree.
0	Well-typability only considers species if forced to.
0	In the case of ~, well-typability can be estahlished by consklering type t alone, without the l)artition condition forcing one to find a well-typed species subsumed hy t. Consequently, well-tyl)ahility overlooks the part offl exehisively encoded by the ai)propriateness specifications for t' and t".
0	Type resolution, on the other hand, always considers species.
0	Thus, type resolving 9o cannot overlook the part of p exclusively encoded by tile appropriateness specifications for t' and t'.
1	APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification, i.e., if F and F'E DRFS then F U F' E DRFS.4 Given this property, it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability.
1	It would, of course, not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures.
